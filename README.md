## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are many great ReadME templates available on GitHub, however, I struggled to find any ReadME generators. Throughout my open source project contributions, I've had to spend numerous hours editing README files which I could've spent developing instead. This paired with me often forgetting to change links, titles and sections made me look for a README generator.

Whilst alternative options existed, I struggled to find one that could suit my needs whilst being fast and easy to use, the ones I found were command-line based, only taking a limited input with the inability to go back on, as such I've built this, a README Generator!

With this open-source project, I hope to allow you to save as much time as it saved me, the benefits of this project are huge and here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. Whilst this template has served my needs, it may not serve yours so I'll be continuing to work on this to make a more "Universal" and "Flexible" ReadME Generator in the future. Feel free to suggest changes by opening a new issue, or if you want to implement your own, feel free to fork this repo and create a pull request.
